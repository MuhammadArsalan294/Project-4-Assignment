Milestone #4: Play multiple rounds
Milestones 1-3 make up a single round of the game. Now that your game logic is sound, you can remove the line printing out the computer's number. Next, 
write code to play multiple rounds of the game! How many rounds should they play you ask? We've provided you with the NUM_ROUNDS constant. NUM_ROUNDS is the 
number of rounds you should have the user play. For reference, in the first example, we had NUM_ROUNDS = 3. After each round, add a blank line to separate 
the rounds visually. Make sure to print out the round number as well!

Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
Round 1
Your number is 22
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 23

Round 2
Your number is 76
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: higher
Aww, that's incorrect. The computer's number was 81

... (more rounds are played)
