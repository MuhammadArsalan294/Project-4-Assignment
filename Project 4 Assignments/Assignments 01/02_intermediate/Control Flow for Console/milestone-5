Milestone #5: Adding a points system
Keep track of the player's score! You should print out the player's score after each round. After this step, you will have coded up the entire game!

Extension #1: Safeguard user input
Get user input for their choice of whether they think their number is higher or lower than the computer's number.

Welcome to the High-Low Game!
Round 1 Your number is 1 Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: even Please enter either higher or lower: lower You were right! 
The computer's number was 6 Your score is now 1

Extension #2: Conditional ending messages
Add conditional messages at the end which gauge players on how they performed! For ours, we evaluated the player and gave them separate messages if:

they had a perfect game

... Your score is now 5

Wow! You played perfectly!

they won at least half the rounds (rounded down)

... Your score is now 2

Good job, you played really well!

they won less than half the rounds

... Your score is now 1

Better luck next time!
