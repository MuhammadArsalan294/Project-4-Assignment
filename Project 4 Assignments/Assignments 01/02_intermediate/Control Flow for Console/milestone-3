Milestone #3: Write the game logic
Write code that maps out all the ways to win the round and prints out the results. When does the user win? How might we check for this? (Note: If you and 
the computer share the same number, the computer should win since your number wouldn't be higher nor lower.)


Welcome to the High-Low Game!
--------------------------------
The computer's number is 79
Your number is 3
Do you think your number is higher or lower than the computer's?: lower
You were right! The computer's number was 79
