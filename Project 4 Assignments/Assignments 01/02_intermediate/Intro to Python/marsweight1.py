Problem: Planetary Weight Calculator
Milestone #1: Mars Weight
A few years ago, NASA made history with the first controlled flight on another planet. Its latest Mars Rover, Perseverance, has onboard a 50cm high helicopter 

called Ingenuity. Ingenuity made its third flight, during which it flew faster and further than it had on any of its test flights on Earth. Interestingly, 

Ingenuity uses Python for some of its flight modeling software!

When programming Ingenuity, one of the things that NASA engineers need to account for is the fact that due to the weaker gravity on Mars, an Earthling's weight 

on Mars is 37.8% of their weight on Earth. Write a Python program that prompts an Earthling to enter their weight on Earth and prints their calculated weight on Mars.

The output should be rounded to two decimal places when necessary. Python has a round function which can help you with this. You pass in the value to be rounded 

and the number of decimal places to use. In the example below, the number 3.1415926 is rounded to 2 decimal places which is 3.14.

x = 3.1415926
rounded_x = round(x, 2) # rounds x to 2 decimal places 
print(rounded_x) 

# This would print out out 3.14

x = 2.71828
rounded_x = round(x, 4)
print(rounded_x)

# This would print out 2.7183

x = 3
rounded_x = round(x, 4)
print(rounded_x) 

# This would print 3
# Note that the round function does not add on decimal places that are not there already 

Sample Run

$ python marsweight.py

Enter a weight on Earth: 120

The equivalent on Mars: 45.36 

Sample Run

$ python marsweight.py

Enter a weight on Earth: 186

The equivalent on Mars: 70.31

# Program to calculate weight on Mars

def main():

    earth_weight = float(input("Enter a weight on Earth: ")) # Get the user's weight on Earth
    # User ka weight input me liya ja raha hai (e.g., 70 kg).
    # float() use kiya gaya hai taake decimal values bhi support ho sakein.
    
    mars_weight = earth_weight * 0.378 # Calculate the weight on Mars (37.8% of Earth's weight)
    # Mars ka gravitational pull sirf 37.8% hota hai Earth ke mukable.
    # Is liye, Earth ka weight 0.378 se multiply kar diya.
    # Example:
    # Agar Earth pe 70 kg hai:
    # mars_weight = 70 * 0.378 = 26.46 kg
    
    mars_weight_rounded = round(mars_weight, 2) # Round the result to 2 decimal places
    # round() function use kiya hai taake sirf 2 decimal places tak result aaye.
    # Example:
    # 26.4626 â†’ 26.46
    
    print(f"The equivalent on Mars: {mars_weight_rounded}") # Display the result
    # Final output print ho raha hai.

if __name__ == "__main__": # Call the main function
    main()
    # Program ko execute karne ke liye main() function call kiya gaya hai.
